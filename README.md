# Restriction Site Distribution in the Genome
Load any sequnece, identify the positions of restriction sites, and anylize their distribution. 

We found restriction site distribution to be mostly uniform in human chromosomes 1 and 7, except for some highly anomylous regions around the centromeres. Uniformity was determined by fitting consecutive site distances to an exponential distribution. Other analyses which could be performed include computing the autocorrelation of the distances between consecutive sites, and looking at the distribution of the number of sites per binned region of the genome, which should be poission distributed if the sites are uniform.
